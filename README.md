<h1 align="center">
  E-commerce-app
</h1>

This is an application that has been built out and developer using [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). It also implements [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/).

This is an E-commerce clothing app built to challenge myself and push me outside of my comfort zone to work with upcoming, unfamiliar technologies. But most importantly to put what I've learnt into practice by trying to build a real world application. It uses firebase for user authentication and mirrors logic to add items to your cart.

I've tried to build this following best practice, I will try and continue to update it by adding new tests and features, if you have any improvements or advice please let me know 🙏

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Install the site locally to make any changes.**

   First you want to download the repo locally, do so by using `git clone` followed by the url to the repository.

   Or just copy and paste this into your terminal `git clone https://github.com/raymondpoon95/E-commerce-app.git`

   Now before you try and run the project it is important to use npm install first, as this project uses npm and has peer dependencies.
   `npm install`

2. **Getting it up and running.**

   Make sure that you have `Node` installed on your machine before running the next line of code.

   If you do not understand how to install node here is a [small guide](https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/) that you can follow.

   Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Now you should be able to see it running locally at `http://localhost:3000/`

   Now you can start changing the code as much as you want and you will be able to see the changes in real time as well! 😎
